hello hello
is there anybody in there 
just not if you can hear me
is there anyone at home
come on down
i cant ease your peain
get you on your feel again
relax
i need some infomation first
just the basic facts
can you show me where it hurts
there is no pain
you are receding
a distance ship smoke on the horizon
you are only coming through in waves
you lips move
but i cant hear what you are saying
when i was a child i had fever
my head so light like a baloon
now ive got that feeling once again
i cant explaing
you will not understand
this is how i am
iiiiiii have become
comfortably numb.....
